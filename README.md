# D3_data_journalism

In this challenge, the scatter plot shows the relationship between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
With using the D3, a scatter plot is created to represent each state with circle elements which include state abbreviations in the circles.
The axes and labels have been created and situated to the left and bottom of the chart.
The data in the form of csv, has been used by using the d3.csv function.

Then additional labels have been placed in the scatter plot and given them click events so that users can decide which data to display. 
The transitions for circles' locations as well as the range of axes have been animated. 
It has been done for three risk factors for each axis. 
All of the CSV data has been binded to the circles to let the users easily determine their x or y values when clicking the labels.
